🤖 JARVIS – AI Voice Assistant (Python)

JARVIS is a desktop-based AI-powered voice assistant built using Python. It listens for voice commands, performs system and web-based tasks, and responds using text-to-speech. The project includes a modern GUI and supports AI-driven conversational responses using Perplexity AI.

📌 Features

🎙️ Wake-word based voice activation (“Jarvis”, “Hey Jarvis”)

🧠 AI-powered responses using Perplexity API

🖥️ Modern desktop GUI built with Tkinter + ttkbootstrap

🔊 Text-to-speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)

🌐 Open websites (Google, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.)

▶️ Play songs via YouTube search

🖱️ Open desktop applications using voice commands

📡 Control system features (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth – Windows only)

📰 Fetch and read latest news headlines

🧵 Multi-threaded execution for smooth UI performance

📦 Convert project into a standalone .exe using PyInstaller
